<div class="hello p-2">
    <p>As businesses across the US commit to a greener future, it seems the days of free plastic bags in every grocery store are numbered. In fact, recent bans designed to discourage their use have been sweeping the nation, with California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, New York, Oregon, and Vermont imposing state-wide legislation on single-use plastic bags.</p>
    <p>The rationale is clear—plastic bags are one of the most prevalent items of trash in both landfills and the ocean and this, combined with the fact that plastic bag recycling is now on the rise, means many more states are likely to follow suit in the coming months and years.
    
    </p>
    <p>However, while recycling plastic bags has, historically been problematic, it’s not impossible, and until we witness worldwide decline in production and usage, there’s likely to be plenty of demand for services dedicated to dealing with these products – especially in light of COVID-19 and the temporary ban of reusable bags in so many places of business. To help get to the bottom of the plastic bag recycling process, here we look at nine plastic bag recycling facts so you have all the information you need to reduce, reuse, and recycle effectively.

                        </h3>
                        <p class="card-text">The plastic bag we recognize today was invented by Swedish engineer Sten Gustaf Thulin in the 1960s. While other multi-material bags had been developed in the previous decade, Thulin was the first to create a simple one-piece bag with a high-load capacity. However, Thulin intended these durable bags for long term use that would negate the need to chop down trees for paper bags.</p>

      <p class="card-text">While it is difficult to measure the true scale of plastic bag use, it is estimated that 5 trillion plastic bags are used each year across the globe! The US contribution to this figure is around 100 billion, with 12 billion barrels of oil required for manufacturing. Even with recent calls for a reduction in plastic bag use, effective plastic bag recycling will be highly important to deal with the number of bags already in existence.</p>

                        </h3>
                        <p class="card-text">We already know that most plastic shopping bags and produce bags will only be used once, and this addiction to single-use plastics can be largely attributed to plastics industry lobbyists. However, it is also estimated that each plastic bag is used for only 12 minutes on average before being discarded. So, regardless of the fact that certain industries would prefer to keep single-use bags in circulation, refusing bags, keeping them in use for longer, and ensuring they are diverted to plastic bag recycling programs remains within consumers’ hands.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Not only are shopping bags non-biodegradable, taking up to 500 years to break down, but once they do begin to decompose, they release microplastics into the environment. Much has been written recently regarding the danger of microplastics, however, the true impact of microplastics is still unknown despite the fact that they have now been discovered at every stage of the food chain.</p>

                        </h3>
                        <p class="card-text">The destructive impact of our over-reliance on plastic bags is clear, however, the good news is they are 100% recyclable. Most bags are made from high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), or linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) which can be recycled with specialist machines. You can find more information on what kind of bags and films can be sent to your plastic bag recycling center here.</p>
